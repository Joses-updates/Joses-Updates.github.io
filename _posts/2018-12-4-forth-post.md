## StockX

StockX is an app for people to resell shoes or to buy shoes for resale price.
But Beware they do not sell shoes for retail price. One thing I like about StockX is they send whatever you are buying to
their headquarters for authentications

## Goat

Goat is another shoe reselling app. Just like StockX Goat send everything you purchase for authentication and give 
you a card of authentication. Personally Goat is better if you wanna sell sneakers. 
Goat also allows you to sell deadstock or used shoes on their app.
